### Binary Search Tree Project

This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum:

https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-binary-search-trees

In my opinion, I gained a solid introductory-level understanding of various algorithms relating to binary search trees in the process of completing this project, such as:

- the algorithm to insert a node in a binary tree
- the algorithm to delete a node in a binary tree
- binary tree traversal algorithms
- the algorithm to balance a binary tree

To help prepare for the assignment, I completed these exercises:

The project file is in the `lib` folder, and can be executed through the bst_test_suite.rb file in the `test` folder.

I wrote the self-educational pseudocode.rb file to solidify my understanding of the delete algorithm, which I found hard to understand and implement.
